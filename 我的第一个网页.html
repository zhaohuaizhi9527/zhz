<p>Steve Jobs' last words on deathbed</p>

<p> reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is an epitome of success.</p>

<p>However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to.</p>

<p>At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death.</P>


<p>In the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of god of death drawing closer …</p>

<p>Now I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth …</p>

<p>Should be something that is more important:</p>

<p>Perhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days</p>

<p>Non-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me.</p>

<p>God gave us the senses to let us feel the love in everyone’s heart, not the illusions brought about by wealth.</p>

<p>The wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love.</p>

<p>That’s the true riches which will follow you, accompany you, giving you strength and light to go on.</p>

<p>Love can travel a thousand miles. Life has no limit. Go where you want to go. Reach the height you want to reach. It is all in your heart and in your hands.</p>

<p>What is the most expensive bed in the world?</p>

<p>Sick bed …</p>

<p>You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you.</p>

<p>Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost — Life.</p>

<p>When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading — Book of Healthy Life.</p>

<p>Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down.</p>

<p>Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends.</p>

<p>Treat yourself well. Cherish others.</p>
